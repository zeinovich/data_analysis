# data_analysis
Starting my path as data analyst or ML engineer, I thought it was good to start with public datasets from kaggle and step-by-step explore various subjects that computer
science got for me. As a main tool for cleaning and analysis, I use Python (pandas, numpy) and sometimes do simple visualization with matplotlib. However, I think there
are more powerful and convenient tools for visualization such as PowerBI and Tableau, though I only at the beginning of learning them.

As for me, I have some background in statistics and analysis (passed an exam in uni with A) and feel comfortable with main concepts, such as mean, std, confidence
intervals, probability, dependence/independence and correlation. 

Requisites: 
- Python >3
- Packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib
