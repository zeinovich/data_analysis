# Netflix Data: Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization
The analysis is done on Netflix Data: Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ariyoomotade/netflix-data-cleaning-analysis-and-visualization)
The task is to clean, analyze and visualize dataset. Cleaning and analysis is (or will be) done in Python, visualization will be done in PowerBI.

- Dataset has around 2800 nulls (out of appr. 9000 rows) in it, so those can't be discarded
- For treating missing data I used 3 algorithms (based on title and date_added)
- This algorithm is unable to treat 1500 rows (appr. 20%) seemingly those that are "alone" and do not have any pattern to find
- Visualization is done in PowerBI

**It is only firts page, see Netflix Data in PowerBI for more**
