#Insurance Fraud

The project is done on the insurance fraud dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/girishvutukuri/insurance-fraud)
The goal is to clean data, make visualization and build ML model to predict if fraud has taken place. Such kind of model may be
interesting for fintech companies which tackle with fraudelence every day, so building effective fraud detection can save millions
of dollars each year. 

In my view, it's a good problem to solve since it may give hints on what really happens in fraud detection in real companies
