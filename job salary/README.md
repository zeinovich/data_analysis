# Data Science Job Salaries
The analysis is done on Data Science Job Salaries dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries)
Though dataset is pretty small (~600 rows), it was interesting to find some patterns, like a drop in salaries across all experience levels in 2021 (drop a line here
if you have any idea why). 

- Stats are done using scipy.stats
- Hypotheses are formulated and tested in Jupyter Notebook file
- Visualized using PowerBI

To play with visuals I encourage you to open it in PowerBI
